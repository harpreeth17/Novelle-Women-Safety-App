# Novelle – Women’s Safety & Empowerment Ecosystem 🛡️
**Status:** 🚀 Pre-MVP / Active Development  
**Role:** Lead Full Stack Developer

## 📖 Project Overview:
Novelle is a comprehensive safety application designed to bridge the gap between technology and personal security. By integrating **Real-time Geolocation**, **AI-driven assistance**, and **Emergency Response Protocols**, Novelle empowers women to navigate their environments with confidence.

Unlike standard safety apps, Novelle utilizes a **Privacy-First Architecture** to allow for anonymous reporting and community-driven safety mapping.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
* **Frontend:** React Native (Planned), HTML5/CSS3 (Current Prototype)
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Django), JavaScript
* **AI Integration:** Gemini Pro / GPT-4 / Claude (for Chatbot & Contextual Search)
* **APIs:** Google Maps API (Geolocation), Twilio (SMS/SOS)
* **Database:** Firebase / PostgreSQL

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Advanced AI Assistant:
* **Context-Aware Chatbot:** Provides instant safety advice, legal resources, and situational guidance using LLMs.
* **Smart Search:** Parses natural language to find "Safe Zones," police stations, or legal aid centers.

### 2. 📍 Geospatial Safety Architecture:
* **Live Tracking:** Real-time location sharing with trusted contacts.
* **Safe Route Navigation:** Visualizes the nearest critical infrastructure (Police, Hospitals) on an interactive map.

### 3. 🚨 Emergency Response System:
* **Quick SOS:** One-tap panic button triggers immediate SMS alerts with live coordinates.
* **Crowdsourced Reporting:** Anonymous "Report Harassment" feature to flag unsafe zones on a community heat map.

### 4. 🔒 Privacy & Security:
* **MFA Login:** Dual-layer authentication via Google Auth and OTP.
* **Discreet Mode:** UI designed for rapid accessibility during high-stress situations.
